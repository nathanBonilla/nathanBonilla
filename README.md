<h2> GitHub Project Updates</h2>
<li> 04-30-2022: BonillaProject.com has been successfully migrated to utilize Django!  The next step is to migrate the projects to the new portfolio app.  I'm so excited to see everything come to fruition!

## What Am I Working On Now?
<p>
    <li> Projects- Migrating the rest of my apps to bonillaProject.com and have them be accessible via my portfolio
    <li> Data Structures and Algorithms- Constantly honing problem solving and critical thinking skills!
