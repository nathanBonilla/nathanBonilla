<h2> GitHub Project Updates</h2>
<li> 05-30-2022: BonillaProject.com has been deployed!  I'll be implementing responsive design for mobile, but this is a very satisfying milestone to hit.  

## What Am I Working On Now?
<p>
    <li> Projects- I'm working on my own personal dashboard using React frontend and Django backend!  I'll be spending my downtime by refining my other projects.
    <li> Data Structures and Algorithms- Constantly honing problem solving and critical thinking skills!
